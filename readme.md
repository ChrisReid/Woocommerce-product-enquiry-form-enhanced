Purpose
=======

This is an enhancement to the existing 'Woocommerce Product Enquiry Form'. In a shop I set up, I wanted to enable a special feature for external / affiliate products:

I wanted to be able to add an 'Enquire Now' button so that when clicked it would scroll down to the Product Enquiry Form, select the form tab and focus on the first input element of the form ready to take and enquiry.

So I wrote this tiny little plug-in which does nothing more than add a small jQuery script to the page.

1. Simply add to your plugins directory and activate the plugin.

2. Then create your product as an externam / afilliate product and ensure that the URL of the product is pointing to '#product-enquiry'.

And that's it.
